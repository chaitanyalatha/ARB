## **About VACMOP**

In this project we developed some APIs and blueprints. APIs are deliverables. We mostly worked on Windows part.

### ***Technical Aspects***

**SivaPrasad:** 

We build AMIs using Packers for workstations, etc. For SQL servers we have used Terraform, because it requires machine multiple reboots.

We gone through Chocolatey for implementing all the workstation softwares.

Other than the TFS, SQL server and Sharepoint we prepared Terraform scripts along with Powershell scripts.

While we are working on this project, we got new requirements from client as shown below.![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RdeOsPtuquHQamH68dVpnAH23p983v3j5CAsnLT3HompP2LdKfV4V4VW179m7bYGWkNIOi2b7ZzgC1tqkNkAxXYN0sZUo6jU5eiVyXFatDfTRWUDfaj1iTL7QRp0ooBgaZ0COh6S)We have build AMIs for them as well.

**Prasad:** 

This is US GovCloud project. We have developed blueprints and shared AMIs to Bernie. Bernie was executing the blueprints in GovCloud Env and we were supporting at that time.

## **Project Details**

**SivaPrasad**: The following table shows the details of project.![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7yU90kUUfDeAkNzdNVDbR1S9MLKOUCRWd7ubSJfi_aaUN3piCG5vHo2N8X7DrouhZiICUxET2A52-L0pnw0KTFTT1vLvPpFu96cF8HdAS9o0vsFhIqriYu0-HLI3x_btVMeS9BpR)

Since we donâ€™t have Govcloud access, when we are building the infrastructure, we have used REAN Test for testing VPC validation and logging. For their environment we did a centralized logging as well.
